  a JavaScript demo by <oxy>
  submitted for the Wild Demo Compo at TLK LAN 2010.4

recommendation
  the demo is best viewed with chrome or chromium browser. it has also been checked with
  the following browsers: firefox 4, opera 11. opera works fine but unfortunately firefox
  is close to unwatchable on linux at least. later on i'll try to figure out the
  bottlenecks/bugs to make it watchable - after all firefox is an awesome browser which
  should be able to handle these renderings, i'm guessing the problem is on my side.
